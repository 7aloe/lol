see these socks, they're dirty
i mean they're really dirty
like i put these on after i got off work
and i went into the gym in them
i went to a barbecue in them
and they i mean they smell bad
it's hot i was sweating so
i mean they're gross
and knowing you, you'd probably like to put them in your mouth
which is like gross and pathetic as fuck
but i know you'd like that
and i mean you could of course
it'd be gross and unappealing to anyone probably
except for you
because you're a pathetic piece of shit
if you really paid me to smell these
that'd be sad
i mean that'd be really really sad
but of course you'd love them
and you'd love to smell them but
you'd have to pay and you'd have to pay a good price
because really, you don't deserve it
but if you paid, i'd let you
and it's kinda sad that you'd pay just for me to send you a pair of socks in the mail
i'd probably make you pay like $35 cus i want money from you
and i deserve to get money if i'm giving you my socks
that's just how it works right?
and only pathetic people would pay for socks
i'd love to take your money from you just so you can smell my socks like a fucking loser
i mean like yikes
here they are
i know you'd love to get these in the mail
especially if i wore em for a week
oh you'd love that
i know you'd love that, trustttt
too bad that you can't have them yet
until i wear them for a week and until i get your money like i want
